# Thanawat Riencharoen - Associate Data Analyst Portfolio 

## About Me
Hi! my name is Thanawat Riencharoen. I am a recent gratudate BBA student at Srinakharinwirot. I am currently working as a graphic designer and general manager in my medium-size printery family business which has about 30empoyees (Nakornluang Printing co.,ltd), so I am familiar with common data management and data analysis in Excel. I also implement Excel VBA and python to automate the Layout calculation and the OT calculation process. I am recently finishing a Google Data Analysis Specialization course, which helps me greater understand the basics of the data analysis process, such as data preparation, data cleaning, data visualization, and be able to use the common data analysis tools such as SQL and R language for querying and analyzing massive data sets to make a data-driven decision.

## Data Analysis Projects
### Study Case: Analyze Cyclist Behavior
This is my analysis for the Google analysis capstone study case, In the study case, the raw data of the historical bicycle trip was provided, and I have to use the data analysis process to explore the differences between two types of rider behavior, the causal riders, and the annual member riders, then I use that information to come up the recommendation plans to convert the causal riders to the annual member plan base on the analysis.

### Excel VBA, Layout Calculator for Paper Cutting | Coding Project
Working in a printery, one of the most delaying processes I found was the layout planning process for cutting the paper. Every time the printery's required to cut paper to an unusual size, the person responsible for cutting the paper has to calculate the most efficient way to cut the paper,  to get the most paper sheet out of it. The process can take from 3 to 10 minutes, depending on the complication of the layout. I think this layouting process can be automated by creating a layout calculator using the Excel VBA code, so I created this layout calculator.

The calculator only takes 2inputs, the size of the original and the desired paper. Then it will calculate the maximum designed sheets you will get, the cutting layout, and the leftover paper dimension and percentage. You can view the code that makes this calculation work [here](https://github.com/prinofprin/excel_paper_layout_calculator/blob/048d3a03d3b329b48013322a9a982dbf5a2b343c/VBA%20code).

### Does rice cause obesity? Tableau Rice Consumption to Obesity Dashboard
Recently, I was a fan of Intermediate fasting and Keito diet which is to avoid eating sugar and carbohydrates and instead eat protein and good kinds of fat for a healthier diet. One of the food that Keito dieters want to avoid is rice. Rice was blamed as one of the main causes of obesity due to its high carbohydrates content which will turn into sugar after digestion. As a heavy rice eater myself, I would like to know whether I should stop eating rice or not, so I pull the data from IFO and relative sources to find the collation between rice and other foods consumption to obesity rate.

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1650622481024' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='World Obesity to Rice Consumption per Capita Map (2015-2017) ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;TN&#47;TNCZ4W9GS&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='path' value='views&#47;WorldObesitytoRiceConsumptionperCapitaMap2015-2017&#47;WorldObesitytoRiceConsumptiondashboard?:language=en-US&amp;:embed=true' /> <param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;TN&#47;TNCZ4W9GS&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' />

 
Result: Contradict to what I heard, rice consumption has an inverse correlation with obesity rate while sugar and meat have a direct correlation. This means there is a correlation between the country that consume more rice and the less obesity rate the country has. However, the dashboard only shows the correlation, not causation, so further analysis is needed to determine the cause.
